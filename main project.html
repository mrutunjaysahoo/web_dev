                    Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is
                    worth knowing can be taught.

                    The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence
                    plus character - that is the goal of true education.

                    The online exam system is the methodology used to examine student’s output for their skills and
                    abilities. The examination is the detailed inspection of the person’s knowledge or proficiency in a
                    subject or profession. Our Online exam software is also the set of questions to test students’
                    understanding of their abilities or aptitude or maybe physical fitness in any zone of their
                    qualifications using the internet and computers.

                    Pupils compete with the same field batch mates. Exams are conducted on a piece of paper at the
                    particularly given center hall, and this has been the same from ancient times. But what if the
                    examination is more manageable and convenient to the students, according to their place and time.
                    However, the computer-based test software keeps on changing and evolving with the passing time.
